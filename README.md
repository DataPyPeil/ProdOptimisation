# Strategic Logistics 

## Project Overview  
This project is designed to simulate the complexities of managing global logistics and production. It explores the impact of production location, transportation costs, customs fees, and environmental factors on a company’s operational performance.  

## Project Scope  
It simulates the role of a **Strategic Planning Manager** responsible for managing production and distribution across multiple factories worldwide. The objective is to optimize cost, fulfill customer demand, and minimize environmental impact through strategic decision-making.  

### Key Features  
1. **Supply Chain Modeling**: A system will be developed to allocate production across different factories and define the flow of products to various global markets.  
2. **Cost and Risk Optimization**: The simulation will account for production costs, transportation fees, customs expenses, and supply chain risks.  
3. **Environmental Impact**: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be modeled based on production location, factory size, product type, and logistics flows.  

### Product and Factory Details  
- **Product Types**:  
  - P1: Low-end  
  - P2: Mid-range  
  - P3: High-end  
- **Factory Types**: Small, medium, and large, each with varying production capacities and efficiency.  
- **Global Zones**: Factories and customers are distributed across Africa, North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.  

### Objective  
Simulate real-world production and logistics challenges. The aim is to create a realistic, strategic experience where decisions have meaningful impacts on the company’s performance and environmental footprint.  

## Technical Details  
Developed using **Python**, with a focus on:  
- Data modeling and optimization  
- Simulating financial and environmental impacts  
- Evaluating strategic decisions and their outcomes
